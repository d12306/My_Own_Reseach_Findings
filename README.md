# My Reseach-Findings
This is some interesting demo code during my exploration towards serious topics. Keep updating...  
## Tips for training networks using Tensorflow:
### 1.Never add any additional computations in sess.run(). That will generate additional graphs that slows down the computation!
## Tips for training classification Networks.
### 1. Never
